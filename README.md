# cam-practice
I have done three courses on Coursera provided by Autodesk on Autodesk Fusion 360 software. These are the files of the practice exercises.
1. Course1: Introduction to CAD, CAM and Practical CNC machining
2. Course2: 3 axis machining
3. Course3: Creating toolpath for CNC lathe

I have uploaded 3 files for each course. Instructions file consists the challenge/problem given to the students. After solving the problem NC file is generated using the software. Submission file contains link to the "f3d" file that is Autodesk Fusion 360 file extension.
